Q: As the number of input signals increases, how does the bias change?

Suppose we have n number of input (x1, x2, x3, ..., xn):

+ If bk = -n -> the MP neuron will produce AND logic 
+ If bk = -1 -> the MP neuron will produce OF logic
+ If bk < n  -> the MP neuron will always produces 1 (firing state)
+ If bk > b  -> the MP neuron will always produces 0 (quiescent state)
